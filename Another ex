10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. 
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.
"From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008"
Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.


name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1:
    name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

counts = dict()

for line in handle:
    words = line.split()
    
    for word in words:
        if word == "From":
            date = words[words.index("From")+5][:2]
            counts[date] = counts.get(date,0)+1

l = []

for k,v in counts.items():
    l.append( (k,v) )

sort = sorted(l) 

for x,y in sort:
    print(x,y)
